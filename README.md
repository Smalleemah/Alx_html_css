- Button hover/active effect: opacity: 0.9

🎨 Design Reference

- Based on a Figma file (duplicated to my drafts)
- Fonts used:
  - Source Sans Pro
  - Spin Cycle OT (ensure these are installed or linked via web)
- Some Figma values were in float — rounded for cleaner implementation

📱 Responsiveness

The layout automatically adjusts for smaller screens:

- On screens ≤ 480px, the mobile version activates
- Content stacks vertically and remains readable and accessible
